# Natural-Language-Processing
* Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) and computational linguistics that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language.
* The goal of NLP is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful.
* This involves a range of tasks from basic text processing to complex understanding and generation of human language.

  # NLP TEXT CLASSIFIER
  * Text classification also known as text tagging or text categorization is the process of categorizing text into organized groups.
  * By using Natural Language Processing (NLP), text classifiers can automatically analyze text and then assign a set of pre-defined tags or categories based on its content.
  # My project's goal:
  * Topic Detection: the task of identifying the theme or topic of a piece of text (e.g. know if a product review is about Ease of Use, Customer Support, or Pricing when analyzing customer feedback).

  # NLP PROJECT - IRISH POEM GENERATOR
  * In This project, instead of classifying the data into different themes or topics, we use the previous words of a seed text, to generate new words
  * we use :
  * LSTM's(Long Short-Term Memory) model
  * Embedding layer
  * dense layers
 
  # The basic concepts required:
  * Tokenization: Tokenization is a fundamental preprocessing step in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves splitting text into smaller units called tokens. These tokens can be words, phrases, or even characters. Tokenization is crucial because it converts raw text into a structured format that can be easily analyzed by NLP models and algorithms.
  * converting text to sequences
  * padding the sequence
  * deep learning
